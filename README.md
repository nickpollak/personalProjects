# Personal Projects
Welcome to my repository, this is a collection of the work I've done in college and some things I'm working on for myself

I am a competent programmer and would love to connect!


### Running project Ideas:
- Upload music or link to music and have it analyzed on why is sounds good and what about the chord progression or the sound makes it pleasing to the ear
- Then have it give a ranking to how well it follows "rules" of music
- finally have it give recommendations as to key or following notes or improvements to be made
