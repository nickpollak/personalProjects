This was definitely more difficult and time consuming than I had imagined. I started out trying to change the small inline things I had done, then realized I should be using more broad classes for things like photos and h1 headers that I used often. I have much more respect for front end developers now, I spent much longer than I had anticipated on small design issues and was using chatgpt for most of it. The @media and @keyframes in css were very usefull and probably the coolest part of css that I hadn't seen before. I would be interested in trying to play around with making interesting animation or hover concepts for a website, and I really enjoyed the design aspect of this project. After making everything percent based or reactive to flex and stacking on eachother or using max-width to tell images what to do, I felt like I got a better grasp on html and css for the future, and the best practices to use when writing anything by myself. In hindsight I wish I did so many thing differently from the start and kept up better with a css sheet. However, for my first website I'm pretty happy with how things turned out and I think the website functions much better responsively.
